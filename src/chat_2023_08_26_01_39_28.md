The `onDelete` function is a callback function that is called when a todo item needs to be deleted. It takes one parameter `todoItem`, which represents the item to be deleted.

Inside the function, it logs a message to the console with the `todoItem` parameter, just for debugging purposes.

Then, it uses the `setTodos` function (assuming it is a state setter function) to update the `todos` state. It applies a filter function on the `todos` array, which returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition specified in the filter function.

In this case, the filter function checks if each element `e` is not equal (`!==`) to the `todoItem`. If the condition is true, the element is included in the new array. If the condition is false, the element is excluded.

Finally, the `setTodos` function is called with the filtered array, effectively updating the state and removing the `todoItem` from the `todos` array.
